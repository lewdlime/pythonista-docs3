:mod:`cb` --- Connecting to Bluetooth LE Peripherals
====================================================

.. module:: cb

The :mod:`cb` ("Core Bluetooth") module enables you –to connect to Bluetooth LE ("Low Energy") peripherals like the `TI SensorTag <http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag/index.shtml?DCMP=sensortag&HQS=sensortag-bn>`_ (a small and affordable BTLE device that contains various sensors like an IR thermometer, accelerometer, etc.). 

The examples in this documentation assume that you either have a standard Bluetooth LE heartrate monitor, or a TI SensorTag, but the module also works with other types of Bluetooth LE peripherals. Note that "classic" Bluetooth (used for headsets, keyboards, etc.) is NOT supported.

The module is based on the CoreBluetooth framework, but doesn't expose all of its functionality -- for example, it only implements the *central* role, i.e. you can connect to peripherals but not have the device act as a peripheral itself.

Quickstart
----------

The basic procedure for connecting to a Bluetooth LE device and reading data from it involves the following steps:

1. Define a delegate object that is responsible for handling notifications/callbacks about discovered devices (peripherals), services, and service characteristics. The callback methods you can implement are described later on.

2. Call :func:`scan_for_peripherals` to start scanning. In many cases, you will also need to make your device discoverable. For the TI SensorTag you would press the side button.

3. When your delegate receives the ``did_discover_peripheral`` callback, check its name or uuid, and if you found the peripheral you want to connect to, call :func:`connect_peripheral`. You should also keep a reference to the discovered peripheral, because if the object is garbage-collected, you will also lose the connection.

4. If everything went smoothly, the ``did_connect_peripheral`` callback will be called. At this point, you can start discovering the peripheral's services by calling :meth:`Peripheral.discover_services`.

5. When the services of the peripheral have been discovered, you will receive a ``did_discover_services`` callback. You can now access the peripheral's ``services`` attribute, and -- for the services you're interested in -- call :meth:`Peripheral.discover_characteristics`.

6. As you might have guessed, this will result in a ``did_discover_characteristics`` callback. You can now read the value of a characteristic by calling :meth:`Peripheral.read_characteristic_value` (which will result in another callback when the value has been read successfully), or enable notifications for the characteristic by calling :meth:`Peripheral.set_notify_value`.

The following code shows how to connect to a Bluetooth LE heartrate monitor. This particular example assumes that you have a Polar device, but it should be easy to adapt this for a different brand (just change the ``did_discover_peripheral`` method accordingly)::

    import cb
    import sound
    import time
    import struct

    class HeartRateManager (object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.peripheral = None
    
        def did_discover_peripheral(self, p):
            if p.name and 'Polar' in p.name and not self.peripheral:
                self.peripheral = p
                print 'Connecting to heart rate monitor...'
                cb.connect_peripheral(p)
    
        def did_connect_peripheral(self, p):
            print 'Connected:', p.name
            print 'Discovering services...'
            p.discover_services()
    
        def did_fail_to_connect_peripheral(self, p, error):
            print 'Failed to connect: %s' % (error,)
    
        def did_disconnect_peripheral(self, p, error):
            print 'Disconnected, error: %s' % (error,)
            self.peripheral = None
    
        def did_discover_services(self, p, error):
            for s in p.services:
                if s.uuid == '180D':
                    print 'Discovered heart rate service, discovering characteristitcs...'
                    p.discover_characteristics(s)
    
        def did_discover_characteristics(self, s, error):
            print 'Did discover characteristics...'
            for c in s.characteristics:
                if c.uuid == '2A37':
                    self.peripheral.set_notify_value(c, True)
    
        def did_update_value(self, c, error):
            heart_rate = struct.unpack('<B', c.value[1])[0]
            self.values.append(heart_rate)
            print 'Heart rate: %i' % heart_rate

    mngr = HeartRateManager()
    cb.set_central_delegate(mngr)
    print 'Scanning for peripherals...'
    cb.scan_for_peripherals()

    try:
        while True: pass
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        cb.reset()

The following example shows how to do similar things with a `TI SensorTag <http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag/index.shtml?DCMP=sensortag&HQS=sensortag-bn>`_. It will log the value of the temperature sensor (about once per second, very similar to the heartrate monitor example above), and play a sound when any of the two buttons on the SensorTag is pressed::

    import cb
    import sound
    import struct
    
    class MyCentralManagerDelegate (object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.peripheral = None
    
        def did_discover_peripheral(self, p):
            print '+++ Discovered peripheral: %s (%s)' % (p.name, p.uuid)
            if p.name and 'Sensor Tag' in p.name and not self.peripheral:
                # Keep a reference to the peripheral, so it doesn't get garbage-collected:
                self.peripheral = p
                cb.connect_peripheral(self.peripheral)
    	
        def did_connect_peripheral(self, p):
            print '*** Connected: %s' % p.name
            print 'Discovering services...'
            p.discover_services()
    
        def did_fail_to_connect_peripheral(self, p, error):
            print 'Failed to connect'
    
        def did_disconnect_peripheral(self, p, error):

            self.peripheral = None
    
        def did_discover_services(self, p, error):
            for s in p.services:
                if 'AA00' in s.uuid:

                    p.discover_characteristics(s)

Functions
---------

.. function:: set_central_delegate(delegate)

    Set the object that should receive callbacks for events like discovered peripherals, received data, etc.
    
    The delegate can implement the following methods, all of which are optional::
    
        class MyDelegate (object):
            def did_update_state(self):
                # State was updated (e.g. Bluetooth powered on/off)
                pass
            
            def did_discover_peripheral(self, p):
                # You would typically check the peripheral's name/uuid here,
                # and connect via cb.connect_peripheral(p).
                # You should also keep a reference to p (e.g. self.peripheral = p),
                # so that it doesn't get garbage-collected.
                # Note that this may get called multiple times for a single peripheral.
                pass
                
            def did_connect_peripheral(self, p):
                # You would typically call p.discover_services() here
                pass
                
            def did_fail_to_connect_peripheral(self, p, error):
                # `error` is a tuple of error code (integer) and description (string)
                pass
                
            def did_disconnect_peripheral(self, p, error):
                # error is a tuple of error code (integer) and description (string)
                pass
                
            def did_discover_services(self, p, error):
                # Here you would typically call discover_characteristics
                # for the services you're interested in.
                pass
                
            def did_discover_characteristics(self, s, error):
                # You can now read or write the characteristic's value
                pass
                
            def did_write_value(self, c, error):
                pass
                
            def did_update_value(self, c, error):
                # You can now access the characteristic value with c.value
                pass
        
.. function:: set_verbose(flag)

    When set to `True`, all callback events are logged to the console, regardless of whether the delegate (see :func:`set_central_delegate`) implements them or not -- this can be useful for debugging.

.. function:: scan_for_peripherals()

    Start scanning for peripherals that are advertising services.
    
.. function:: stop_scan

    Stop scanning for peripherals.

.. function:: connect_peripheral(peripheral)

    Establish a connection to a peripheral. This will typcially be called from your implementation of the ``did_discover_peripheral`` callback.

.. function:: cancel_peripheral_connection(peripheral)

    Cancel an active or pending local connection to a peripheral.

.. function:: get_state()

    Return the current state of the central manager (see `Constants`_ for possible values)
    
.. function:: reset()

    Disconnect all peripherals. This also sets the central delegate to `None`, so you will no longer receive any callbacks.


Classes
-------

.. note::
    The classes in this module are not intended to be instantiated directly. Instead, you will get instances of the different classes as parameters to callback functions that your delegate implements (see :func:`set_central_delegate`).

Peripheral
^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: Peripheral()

    The :class:`Peripheral` class represents peripheral devices that have been discovered via :func:`scan_for_peripherals`. Peripherals are identified by universally unique identifiers (UUIDs). Peripherals may contain one or more services (represented by :class:`Service` objects).
    
Peripheral Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. method:: Peripheral.discover_services

    Discover the services of the peripheral. The central delegate will receive a ``did_discover_services`` callback when the discovery has finished.

.. method:: Peripheral.discover_characteristics(service)

    Discover the characteristics for the given :class:`Service`. This will typically be called from the ``did_discover_services`` callback. When the characteristics have been discovered, the central delegate will receive a ``did_discover_characteristics`` callback.
    
.. method:: Peripheral.set_notify_value(characteristic, flag=True)
    
    Enable or disable notifications for the given :class:`Characteristic` (note: not all characteristics support notifications). When notifications are enabled, you may receive ``did_update_value`` callbacks in your central delegate (see :func:`set_central_delegate`).

.. method:: Peripheral.write_characteristic_value(characteristic, data, with_response)

    Write the value of a :class:`Characteristic`. `data` should be a byte string. `with_response` determines whether the ``did_write_value`` callback will be called when the write has completed (or failed). Note that not all characteristics support writing values without response.

.. method:: Peripheral.read_characteristic_value(characteristic)

    Retrieve the value of the given :class:`Characteristic`. When the value has been read, your central delegate will receive a ``did_update_value`` callback, at which point you can access the value with the characteristics's ``value`` attribute. Not all characteristics are guaranteed to have a readable value.

Peripheral Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. attribute:: Peripheral.name
    
    The peripheral's name (either a string or `None`)
    
.. attribute:: Peripheral.uuid

    The peripheral's unique identifier (a hex string)

.. attribute:: Peripheral.state

    The peripheral connection state (0 = disconnected, 1 = connecting, 2 = connected)

.. attribute:: Peripheral.services

    The peripheral's discovered services (a list of :class:`Service` objects). Note that this will usually be empty until you have successfully called :meth:`Peripheral.discover_services` (and received the ``did_discover_services`` callback).

Service
^^^^^^^

.. class:: Service()

    :class:`Service` objects represent a :class:`Peripheral`’s service -- a collection of data and associated behaviors for accomplishing a function or feature of a device (or portions of that device). Services are either primary or secondary and may contain a number of :class:`Characteristic`s.

Service Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. attribute:: Service.characteristics

    The service's characteristics (a list of :class:`Characteristic` objects which may be empty if the characteristics haven't been discovered yet)

.. attribute:: Service.primary

    A boolean flag that indicates whether the service is primary or secondary

.. attribute:: Service.uuid

    The service's unique identifier (a hex string)

Characteristic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: Characteristic()

    :class:`Characteristic` objects represent further information about a peripheral’s service. A characteristic contains a single value. The properties of a characteristic determine how the value of the characteristic can be used.

Characteristic Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. attribute:: Characteristic.uuid

    The characteristic's unique identifier (a hex string).

.. attribute:: Characteristic.value

    The characteristic's current value (either a byte string, or `None` if the value hasn't been read yet or there is no value)

.. attribute:: Characteristic.notifying

    A flag that determines whether notifications are enabled for this characteristic (read-only, set via :meth:`Peripheral.set_notify_value`)

.. attribute:: Characteristic.properties

    A bitmask of the characteristic's properties (see ``CH_PROP_*`` constants below)

Constants
---------

Possible return values for :func:`get_state`:

.. data:: CM_STATE_UNKNOWN
.. data:: CM_STATE_RESETTING
.. data:: CM_STATE_UNSUPPORTED
.. data:: CM_STATE_UNAUTHORIZED
.. data:: CM_STATE_POWERED_OFF
.. data:: CM_STATE_POWERED_ON

:class:`Characteristic` properties (note: these values can be combined as a bitmask):

.. data:: CH_PROP_BROADCAST
.. data:: CH_PROP_READ
.. data:: CH_PROP_WRITE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE
