<p>All files in a <em>source package</em> of markdown2 (i.e. those available on
pypi.python.org and the Google Code project &#8220;downloads&#8221; page) are under the
MIT license.  However, in the <em>subversion repository</em> there are some files
(used for performance and testing purposes) that are under different licenses
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">perf/recipes.pprint</p>
<p>Python License. This file includes a number of real-world examples of
Markdown from the ActiveState Python Cookbook, used for doing some
performance testing of markdown2.py.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">test/php-markdown-cases/...
test/php-markdown-extra-cases/...</p>
<p>GPL. These are from the MDTest package announced here:
